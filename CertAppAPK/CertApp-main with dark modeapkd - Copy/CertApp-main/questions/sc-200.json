      "explanation": "- **`| where Operation in ({{Operations}})`**: This safely uses a dynamic parameter in a way that avoids Python or templating conflicts. It allows KQL to match a list of values provided at runtime.\n\n- **`| project Site_Url`**: Filters the output to only include site URLs, inherently excluding null or empty values.\n\nEscaping the curly braces ensures compatibility with template engines and editors without altering the query logic.\n\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/visualize-data#use-parameters-in-kql-queries",
